Morse code is a method used in telecommunications to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signals durations, called dots and dashes, or edits abd dahs.
Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegrapy. 
Morse code was inverted to facilitate long distance communication, particularly for telegraphy systems  Samuel F.B Morse, an American artist and inventor, developed it during the 1830s for electrical telegraphy. His goal was to transmit messages quickly and efficiently over electric telegraph wires. Morse's system used dots, dashes and space to represent letters of the alphabets, numerals and punctuation marks. 
Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots(short signals) and dashes (long signals) 
The dot duration can vary for signal clarity and operater skills, but once established, it becomes the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code. 
A dash is three times the duration of a dot. 
Each dot and dash within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence (a space) equal to the dot duration  
Letters within a word are separated by a space equal to three dots, and word are separated by a space equal to seven dots.
